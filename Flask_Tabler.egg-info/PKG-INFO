        Flask-Tabler packages `Tabler
        <http://gettabler.com>`_ into an extension that mostly consists
        of a blueprint named 'tabler'. It can also create links to serve Tabler
        from a CDN and works with no boilerplate code in your application.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Here is an example::
        
          from flask_tabler import Tabler
        
          [...]
        
          Tabler(app)
        
        This makes some new templates available, containing blank pages that include all
        tabler resources, and have predefined blocks where you can put your content.
        
        As of version 3, Flask-Tabler has a `proper documentation
        <http://pythonhosted.org /Flask-Tabler>`_, which you can check for more
        details.
